My interest in urbanism is rooted in environmental sustainability: long before I got involved in transportation or land use, I tried to make my own habits more sustainable, and help others around me do the same. Over time, I learned about our broader patterns of resource consumption. Because most of Washington’s electricity is already hydroelectric, the fastest, highest impact ways for us to reduce our impact are to shift people’s trips to transit, walking, and biking, so local travel is lower impact, and let people live as close together as they want, so their trips aren’t as far.

These realizations also came from direct experience. I first traveled outside the continent in 2004, on a three week backpacking trip in Japan. Unfortunately, the photos I took there are gone. However, I went back in 2006 with a friend, and I’d like to share some of the more interesting things I saw.
