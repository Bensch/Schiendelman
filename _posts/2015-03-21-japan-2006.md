Much of my love for urbanism comes from visiting cities around the world. I first traveled outside North America in 2004, on a three week backpacking trip to Japan. Unfortunately, the photos I took on that first visit are long gone. However, in 2006 I returned with a friend. Since a lot of the photos I took then have never been posted, here are a handful.

One of the first things I ever did in Japan was eat at one of these self-service bakeries. Each item is paid for separately; you fill your tray with goodies and get coffee when you pay. I loved being able to see every item before buying it. It seems that’s part of food culture in Japan; many businesses have not just pictures but plastic models of food in the windows.

The police box, or “koban”, is something I’ve only seen in Japan. It seems like community policing at its best - they provide eyes on the street better than most storefronts. I’ve even asked them for directions. They’re also a good opportunity for public art - this one seems like a robot head.

Seattle rarely has storefronts this narrow - Japan has them everywhere, and their density makes for amazing variety. This shop in Ginza specializes in “o-musubi”, also known as “o-nigiri”, rice balls filled with tasty goodies. That’s a price list on the outside.

Japan’s massive transportation network means any attraction has access to millions of people. The Ramen museum showcases different varieties of noodles in an underground model of a pre-war neighborhood. It’s not just this one room - there are passageways around the edges!
