Much of my love for urbanism comes from traveling to cities around the world. I first traveled outside North America in 2004, on a three week backpacking trip to Japan. Unfortunately, the photos I took on that first visit are long gone. However, in 2006 I returned with a friend, and much of what we saw is worth sharing.

One of the first things I ever did in Japan was eat at one of these self-service bakeries. Each item is paid for separately (and, unfortunately, often wrapped separately, don’t say ‘to go’!), so I feel it’s actually closer to an automat than a buffet.
