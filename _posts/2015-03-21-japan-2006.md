Much of my love for urbanism comes from visiting cities around the world. I first traveled outside North America in 2004, on a three week backpacking trip to Japan. Unfortunately, the photos I took on that first visit are long gone. However, in 2006 I returned with a friend:

One of the first things I ever did in Japan was eat at one of these self-service bakeries. Each item is paid for separately; you fill your tray with goodies and get coffee when you pay. I loved being able to see every item before buying it. It seems that’s part of food culture in Japan; many businesses have not just pictures but plastic models of food in the windows.

The police box, or “ko-ban”, is something I’ve only seen in Japan. It seems like community policing at its best - they provide eyes on the street better than most storefronts. I’ve even asked them for directions. They’re also a good opportunity for public art - this one seems like a robot head.
